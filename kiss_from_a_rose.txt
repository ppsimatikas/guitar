Theeeere used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
E		   E^		    D			E				
You became the light on the dark side of me
E		    E^              D			E
Love remained a drug that's the high and not the pill

But did you know that when it snows
     E		    D		     E^ 		  D             E
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen?
E				 E^          D             E
Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
E                                  E^        D       E
Ooh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeah
E              E^           D     E^              D            E
Now that your rose is in bloom A light hits the gloom on the grey

There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
E              E^            D         E
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
Baby, to me, you're like a growing addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?

I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
And if I should fall, will it all go away?
I've been kissed by a rose on the grey
There is so much a man can tell you, so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain
To me, you're like a growing, addiction that I can't deny
Won't you tell me, is that healthy, baby?
